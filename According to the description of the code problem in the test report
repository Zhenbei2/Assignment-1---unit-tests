As can be seen from the test report, the implementation of the Python function does not handle the input data correctly in some cases, causing the test to fail. Specifically, the questions are as follows:

1. The test_all_chars, test_chars_not_in_order and test_no_repeating_chars use case tests failed
because the function could not correctly handle the case where all the characters in the input string were different, 
and the output result did not match the expected value. The solution is to specify a special case, the case where all characters in the input string are different, to handle that separately.

2. The test_chars_in_order use case test failed because the function cannot correctly handle the order in which all characters in the input string are arranged, 
and the output result does not match the expected value. The solution is to check whether the last occurrence of the current character is equal to the current position,
and if so, use the current position as a new dividing point.

3. The test_repeating_chars use case test failed because the function cannot correctly handle the situation 
that all characters in the input string are the same, and the output result does not match the expected value. The solution is to return the entire string as a substring.
